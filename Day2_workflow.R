# of plotting in R via ggplot2
#
# and a creating a github account to make pipelines
# for your work
#
# Available at:

# Some short slides are also available at:

#
# I've assumed you've already gone through Day 1
# which means at least you have R, Rstudio installed
# and that you know about some BaseR syntax
# as well as a bit of tidyverse syntax
#
# For setup here, please go to github and create an account:
# https://github.com/join
#
# After you have created an account, download and install
# github desktop on your machine:
# https://desktop.github.com/
#
####
#

## First, let's do a little bit of setup.
#
# let's set our working directory to our workspace (I had mine on my desktop)
# setwd("C:/Users/bvoight/Desktop/ITMAT_Workshop")

# let's also load a library that we'll need: tidyverse
library(tidyverse)

## I. Your first repository
#
# I personally think the *easiest* way to create a new repository
# is to do it on your account on github
#
# then, clone that onto your machine and add things accordingly
#
# https://github.com/ -> Log in -> click on '+' icon in upper left 
# -> new repository 
#
# Name it what you'd like
#
# Give it a description
#
# Let's make this one 'private' for now (you can change this)
#
# Click the boxes "Add a README.md"
#
# "Choose a License" -> MIT License

# Great! You've made your first repo. Now, let's place this onto your
# computer.
#
# Open
